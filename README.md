This was created as an assignment for python concepts and methodology, taken in fall 2020. The assignment was as follows:

Goals:

Create a password generator as outlined above, selecting four common words from a list.
Read the list in from a file (giant_file  Download giant_fileor smaller_file  Download smaller_fileor get your own).
Don't select words that are too small (at least 4 or 5 letters) (attempts to solve this may create infinite loops).
docstrings
Use error handling for file not found and your functions.
Bonus:

You may have to deal with newlines, look into the split method.
Find files with specific words types like nouns and adjectives? (For instance, adj noun adj noun formatting.)
If this were known, how would this effect the complexity of the password?
Output possible passwords as a batch for the user to choose from.
Allow the user to choose the large file or small file to generate words from? (Personally, the large file has too many words I don't know...)


Upon running, the program will ask the user if they would like to choose from the large file or the small file, and generate four passwords that are a combination of four words
chosen from the respective file.
